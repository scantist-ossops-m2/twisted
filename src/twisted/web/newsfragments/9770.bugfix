Fix several request smuggling attacks: requests with multiple Content-Length headers were allowed (thanks to Jake Miller from Bishop Fox and ZeddYu Lu) and now fail with a 400; requests with a Content-Length header and a Transfer-Encoding header honored the first header (thanks to Jake Miller from Bishop Fox) and now fail with a 400; requests whose Transfer-Encoding header had a value other than "chunked" and "identity" (thanks to ZeddYu Lu) were allowed and now fail a 400.
